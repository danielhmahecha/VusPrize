VusPrize - Variants of Uncertain Significance Prioritization Random Forest
Version 1.0.1 (22-08-2021)
===========================================================================

VusPrize provides a random forest model to prioritize variants of uncertain
significance as Pathogenic or Not Pathogenic. VusPrize performs an accurate
prediction of the probability of pathogenicity of a variant for variant 
interpretation pipelines for research purposes.
